In this section we process cells in order but when we are considering
which pairs to place in the current cell we only consider those
pairs that are available for the current cell. We calculate the available
pairs as the intersection Pe of P (the set of all pairs so for not used)
and A (the set of combinations of size 2 from elements not already
used either in the current column or the current row).

One benefit of this approach is that we can study the sets Pe.
Below, for example, we track the sets Pe as the algorithm runs
so that afterwards we can inspect those sets.

```{r greedy3_init}
P <- list(c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(1, 4), c(1, 5), c(2, 3), c(2, 4), c(2, 6), c(3, 4), c(3, 7), c(5, 6), c(5, 7), c(5, 8), c(5, 9), c(5, 10), c(6, 7), c(6, 8), c(6, 9), c(6, 10), c(7, 8), c(7, 9), c(7, 10), c(8, 9), c(8, 10), c(9, 10), c(1, 6), c(1, 7), c(1, 8), c(1, 9), c(1, 10), c(2, 5), c(2, 7), c(2, 8), c(2, 9), c(2, 10), c(3, 5), c(3, 6), c(3, 8), c(3, 9), c(3, 10), c(4, 5), c(4, 6), c(4, 7), c(4, 8), c(4, 9), c(4, 10))
# 
E <- list(c(1, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 3), c(4, 4), c(3, 4), c(4, 2), c(2, 3), c(5, 5), c(4, 3), c(1, 2), c(6, 6), c(7, 7), c(8, 8), c(9, 9), c(7, 8), c(9, 6), c(6, 9), c(8, 7), c(8, 9), c(9, 7), c(1, 4), c(2, 1), c(6, 8), c(7, 6), c(1, 3), c(1, 5), c(1, 6), c(1, 7), c(1, 8), c(1, 9), c(2, 4), c(2, 5), c(2, 6), c(2, 7), c(2, 8), c(2, 9), c(3, 1), c(3, 2), c(3, 5), c(3, 6), c(3, 7), c(3, 8), c(3, 9), c(4, 1), c(4, 5), c(4, 6), c(4, 7), c(4, 8), c(4, 9), c(5, 1), c(5, 2), c(5, 3), c(5, 4), c(5, 6), c(5, 7), c(5, 8), c(5, 9), c(6, 1), c(6, 2), c(6, 3), c(6, 4), c(6, 5), c(6, 7), c(7, 1), c(7, 2), c(7, 3), c(7, 4), c(7, 5), c(7, 9), c(8, 1), c(8, 2), c(8, 3), c(8, 4), c(8, 5), c(8, 6), c(9, 1), c(9, 2), c(9, 3), c(9, 4), c(9, 5), c(9, 8))

This plot is a little bit harder to interpret than it first seems.
The colour of a cell is determined by the constaints on that cell
at the time it was visited by the algorithm. So cells that were
encountered early during the algorithm run are likely to have even
more constraints by the end. Look at cell (2, 4) for example.
It's blue because when that cell was first encountered the only
available pairs had already been used. But now that the algorithm
has finished it belongs to the category of cells for which there
are fewer than 2 available symbols.

Here is a plot of the sizes of the sets Ep as the algorithm runs.

```{r X, include=FALSE}
X <- X %>%
  mutate(
    n = row_number(),
    m = map_dbl(Pe, length)
  )
```

```{r X_plot, echo=FALSE}
X %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = m, colour = fill)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal()
```

The filled cells are coloured blue and the red dots
represent empty cells. As the resulting square is maximal
we end up with a run of empty cells at the end and the
volume of the partial Room square is the number of
blue dots.

Are these plots worth investigating? Can they tell us
anything about the possible volumes of partial Room
squares?

There's nothing to prevent us from ordering the points
in descending order. Or turning the points into columns.

```{r Xplot2, echo=FALSE}
X %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = desc(reorder(n, m)), y = m, fill = fill)) +
    geom_col(width = 1, alpha = .5) +
    theme_minimal()
```

In this plot the sum of the differences in height equals
45.

At first I wondered if a proof might be possible based
on the slope of this curve. Are there some constraints
that prevent this curve from being steep enough to reach
the bottom before 24 (the least volume for a maximal
partial Room square of order 10).

For example, the first drop in this plot has size 17
and it's easy to see why. In the first cell all pairs
are available and so the first point is at 45. In the
next cell we have to remove all 17 other pairs involving
one or other of the two symbols in the first pair because
the current cell either lies in the same row or column.

Now is it interesting to note that we never have another
drop of that height again. Is that always true? In fact
the next biggest drop looks like it's about half the
height of the first one. It seems like maybe there are
some constraints on these heights that would prevent us
reaching 0 too quickly but it's quite hard to understand
what is going on in general.

Also, I wonder if it's valid to do what I've done with
this plot. The first plot really corresponds to a sequence
of partial Room squares that arise from the greedy
procedure. But this plot doesn't have the same connection.
It's just a reordering of the first plot. Is that a problem?

Another observation is that in this example we are
moving along rows and rows will inevitably have at
least four empty cells. So the red dots we see on
the x-axis in little groups of four or five correspond
to rows. In fact, in this case we end up with an
empty last row which are the eight red dots on the
x-axis at the end.

To have positive volume requires that there are gaps
in those red dots. The volume can only happen between
gaps. Does that help? Do the gaps and the drop heights
conspire together to limit the total volume. Actually,
what we are interested in is low volume. We want to
show that a certain minimum volume is required.

```{r X_d_dm}
X <- X %>%
  arrange(desc(m)) %>%
  mutate(
    dm = lag(m),
    d = dm - m
  )
```

Plot the differences.

```{r plot_X_d, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(X, aes(x = 1:81, y = d)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, alpha = .5)
```

Plot a histogram of the non-zero differences.

```{r plot_hist_d}
ggplot(X %>% filter(d != 0), aes(d)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Sum these differences with their weights gives the total number of
unordered pairs.

```{r}
11*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 1*4 + 1*6 + 1*8 + 1*11
```

Is there some symmetry going on here?

What does 11 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17 correspond to?

What does 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 11 = 35 correspond to?

Where is the 24? It's the number of columns in the plot.

Is it possible to find 23 columns whose differences when
arranged in order sum to 45? Of course. Surely.
