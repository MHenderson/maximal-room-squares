Let $n$ denote the order of the partial Room square.
Let $S = \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}$.
Let $P = {S \choose 2}$.

Let
$U(R)$
denote the subset of
$P$
used in
$R$.
Let
$M(R) = P \backslash U(R)$
denote the subset of
$P$
missing from
$R$.

If
$e$
is an empty cell in a partial Room square
$R$
then by
$S(e, R)$
we denote
the subset of
$S$
*seen*
by
$e$.
A symbol is seen by an empty cell
$e$
if it appears in the same row or column
as
$e$.

So
$S \backslash S(e, R)$
is the subset of symbols
not seen by $e$
and
$S \backslash S(e, R) \choose 2$
is the subset of all pairs
made from symbols
not seen by $e$.

Notice that it is possible
for
$S \backslash S(e, R) \choose 2$
to have non-empty intersections
with both
$U(R)$
and
$M(R)$.
In other words those pairs
that are available for an empty
cell when considering only the
symbols in the same row
or column may
or may not
already appear somewhere in R.
