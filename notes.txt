i think i might have been working with a misunderstanding

have i been assuming that i always get a maximal partial Room
square as soon as I have 24 filled cells? Because that is
obviously not the case.

What we are trying to understand is why a partial Room square
needs at least that many symbols to be maximal. Why are
all partial Room squares with fewer filled cells not
maximal?

I think that I've been thinking that something happens
around that boundary between 23 and 24 filled cells. As if
crossing that boundary makes a partial Room square become
maximal. But that is not the case. There are maximal Room
squares with many more filled cells and so there are also
partial Room squares that are not maximal with many more
filled cells. Any of the subsquares of those maximal partial
Room squares with many more filled cells than 24.

I really need to track Pe for every cell after every new
cell has been assigned.

I want to see how those Pe sets change over time.

But that might not be worthwhile in light of the above
observation.
